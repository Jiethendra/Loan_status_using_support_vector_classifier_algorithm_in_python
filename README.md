#Predicting_Diabets_using_MAchine_learning.
In this project I had build a simple machine learning model using KNN algorithm in python to predict whether a person get diabets or not. 
This project involes importing required python libraries (like numpy, pandas, scikit, matplotlib, seaborn, etc) importing data, preprocessing data, standardisation of data, creating knn model using Scikit library, analyzing score using classification report and creating a pickle file
